### ***Description***
#### A game of word play. Each game begins with a 5x5 grid filled with random(ish) letters. There's only one answer! The answer is a combination of the letters on the board, guesses are unlimited but time is not! 
***
### ***Getting Started***
#### User experience begins with a minimal homepage showcasing the name of the game and a play button. Pressing play takes you to the game board. The board will be empty until the "Start" button is pressed. Then the board will fill with letters. Letters database will be similar to the average consonant/vowel balance of Boggle or Scrabble. There is only 1 answer! Word guesses can be typed in to an input field and will be compared to the answer. The user can make as many guesses as they want in 30 seconds. Once the time runs out or the user guesses correctly, the scoreboard will update and the answer will be revealed. Play again?

### ***Extra features***
* Letters that are used in a word guess but do not exist in the answer could be eliminated from the board.
* Short countdown timer at the start of game play.
* A "share to social media" button if the user wins.
