### ***Description***
#### A game of word play. Each game begins with a letter bank containing 25 letters and an empty board with 25 spaces. The challenge: fill the whole board with five-letter words using only the letters from the letter bank.
***
### ***Getting Started***
#### User experience begins with a minimal homepage showcasing the name of the game and a play button. Pressing play takes you to the game board. Letter database fills with a random assortment taken from an array of letters based on the consonant/vowel balance of Scrabble. The board is clickable and a letter can be typed into each grid square. Once the board is filled with as many words as the user wants, they press submit. The submit button then compares the letters in the grid to the letter box and if all grid letters exist in the letter box AND the words exist in the word bank then the score tallies. Pressing "play again" will reset the game board, score and the letter bank.
***
### ***Game Play***
#### To begin, simply click any grid on the game board and type a letter using your keyboard. Any grid can be clicked and any letter can be typed in. Change your mind? Any letter can be changed by simply clicking on the grid and re-typing a new letter. Words are only read left-to-right not up-to-down. Once you think you have every possible letter combination in, press submit. Your score will tally so long as you only used letters from the letter bank and words found in the word bank. You get 5 points per 5-letter-word. Think of a new word combination? Game play is possible even after pressing submit and score will update appropriately. Play again?
