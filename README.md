### ***Description***
#### A game of word play. Each game begins with a 5x5 grid filled with random(ish) letters. There's only one answer! The answer is a combination of the letters on the board, guesses are unlimited but time is not! 
***
### ***Getting Started***
#### User experience begins with a minimal homepage showcasing the name of the game and a play button. Pressing play takes you to the game board. Letters database fills with random letters taken from an array of letters based on the consonant/vowel balance of Scrabble. The board is clickable and a letter can be typed into each grid square. Once the board is filled with as many words as the user wants, they press submit. The submit button then compares the letters in the grid to the letter box and if all grid letters exist in the letter box then the score tallies. Play again?

### ***Extra features***
* Letters that are used in a word guess but do not exist in the answer could be eliminated from the board.
* Short countdown timer at the start of game play.
* A "share to social media" button if the user wins.
